# Crypto End User Best Practices Guide

A guide for cryptocurrency end user best practices.

As new users are onboarded into cryptocurrency, it is difficult for them to quickly understand and follow best practices. In fact, it is difficult for existing crypto users to follow and stay up-to-date on best practices as they evolve over time with new technologies and products.

This guide is proposed as a collaborative effort for listing simple best practices that any crypto user can follow to mitigate risk and improve their experience.

This list of best practices contains general guidelines and DOES NOT represent any guarantee of security or protection of funds. The responsibility remains solely with the end user.

## Best Practices 101
As a cryptocurrency holder, you are constantly guarding against **two things**.

1. THEFT of funds - a bad actor steals your funds.
2. LOSS of funds - you lose access to the private keys needed to transfer and use your funds.

We need to use best practices to protect against both at the same time. When you are complete with your wallet setup, ask yourself if you feel safe against both threats.

## Use a Hardware Wallet
To keep your cryptocurrency, you should utilize a hardware wallet that you physically own. Here are the steps to ensure you are doing this in a best practices manner.

_Note: most industry preferred hardware wallets include an onboarding process that takes you through the following steps. Do not ignore or skip any steps._

1. **Use an industry recommended hardware wallet and purchase from the provider or an authorized retailer.** You should not buy a used hardware wallet unless you are experienced. [Why should I not buy a used hardware wallet?](#why-should-i-usually-avoid-buying-a-used-hardware-wallet)
2. **To use the hardware wallet when connected to a device, you should have to enter a passphrase or pin that you have created.**
3. **The hardware wallet should be backed up by a mnemonic phrase, a series of words.** [What is a mnemonic phrase & why should it use one?](#what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase-and-why-should-it-use-one)
4. **These words should be generated when YOU are setting up the wallet for the first time.** You should NEVER use a wallet that comes with a mnemonic phrase written down and/or is not generated on demand.
5. **Write down the words on multiple pieces of paper.** Never type the words into your computer or take a picture of the paper for a backup.

6. **Store the pieces of paper in separate safe places where others cannot get to them.** Such as a safe, safe deposit box, lockbox, etc. [Why store them in separate places?](#why-store-the-pieces-of-paper-in-separate-places)

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why should I usually avoid buying a used hardware wallet?

A frequent scam involves a bad actor buying and configuring hardware wallets, writing down the mnemonic backup phrase, and reselling the device. Then, once a victims funds are loaded, the bad actor transfers the funds from a new wallet they have set up with the backup phrase.

#### What is a mnemonic phrase and why should it use one?

A mnemonic phrase is a series of words (usually 24 words) that allows your hardware wallet to restore your private keys. The benefit to using a mnemonic phrase over a random long series of numbers & letters is two-fold. Firstly, it is easier to correctly copy the known english words when you are writting your backup. It's easier to write `before` correctly than `bl01Ofe3`. Secondly, if you did incorrectly transcribe a word you can more easily narrow down the correct word. It's easy to see that `befor` is probably `before`.

#### Why should I NEVER put my mnemonic backup phrase on a computer or take a picture of the written words?

Your mnemonic phrase is the backup to all private keys on your device. This means that whoever gets their hands on it has access to transfer any of your cryptocurrencies. If you store it in a file on a computer or have an image of it on your phone, bad actors can possibly get to it and drain your accounts.

#### Why store the pieces of paper in separate places?

As we discussed, we must protect from loss of funds. If a disaster such as a flood or fire destroys your paper backup, you will not have a way to recover your private keys and your funds if the hardware wallet is lost or corrupted.
