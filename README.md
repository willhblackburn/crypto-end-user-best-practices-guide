# Crypto End User Best Practices Guide

A guide for cryptocurrency end user best practices.

As new users are onboarded into cryptocurrency, it is difficult for them to quickly understand and follow best practices. In fact, it is difficult for existing crypto users to follow and stay up-to-date on best practices as they evolve over time with new technologies and products.

This guide is proposed as a collaborative effort for listing simple best practices that any crypto user can follow to mitigate risk and improve their experience.

This list of best practices contains general guidelines and DO NOT represent any guarantee of security or protection of funds. The responsibility remains solely with the end user.
