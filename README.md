# Crypto End User Best Practices Guide

A guide for cryptocurrency end user best practices.

As new users are onboarded into cryptocurrency, it is difficult for them to quickly understand and follow best practices. In fact, it is difficult for existing crypto users to follow and stay up-to-date on best practices as they evolve over time with new technologies and products.
